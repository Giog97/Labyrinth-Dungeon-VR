This project was created for the Computer Graphics exam.

It contains all the code and all the assets used to create a game for VR. The game consists of overcoming some tests to obtain pieces of the map that, when joined together, will allow the player to escape from a maze.

To create this project, assets made available for free on the Unity assets store or that are available online were used.
